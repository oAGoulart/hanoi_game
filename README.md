A simple class assignment I made during my CS undergrad at unipampa.

This assignment consists of implementing a game of towers of hanoi for a human player using data structures such as lists and stacks. For obvious reasons I wasn't meant to use any of the Standard Template Library classes.

The code in this repository was made for educational purposes only, you may use it for fun or to help with your own assignments but I do not recommend it for production use.
